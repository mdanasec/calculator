üîç Using method overloading and switch statements, I've developed a versatile calculator capable of performing addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations. Here's a brief overview of the key features:

üî¢ Method Overloading: Leveraging the power of method overloading, I've designed the calculator to handle operations on different data types seamlessly. Whether it's adding two integers, multiplying two doubles, or combining a double and a long, the calculator adapts to the input types effortlessly.

üîÑ Switch Statements: To provide a user-friendly interface for selecting operations, I've utilized switch statements to efficiently route user inputs to the appropriate calculation methods. This ensures a smooth and intuitive user experience while maintaining code clarity and flexibility.

üíº This project not only demonstrates my proficiency in Java programming but also showcases my problem-solving skills and attention to detail. I'm proud of the outcome and eager to continue exploring new avenues in software development.

üëâ Check out the code on my GitHub profile  and let me know your thoughts! I'm always open to feedback and collaboration opportunities. Feel free to reach out if you're interested in discussing this project further or exploring potential collaborations.
